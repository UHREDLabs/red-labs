            <p>The “Intro to Tech Entrepreneurship” course is designed for students who are interested in tech entrepreneurship, and want to learn more about how to become an entrepreneur. You don’t need an idea for a company, you don’t need a team - you merely need to be interested in using your skills to solve problems with innovative solutions. The class will include guest speakers who will talk about their experiences as entrepreneurs or in a startup, case studies, and workshops. Each session will help students begin to understand how they can identify problems, create solutions, build products and start companies. We will then consider the basic building blocks for starting a company, and lead you to the resources you need should you choose to pursue entrepreneurship.</p>
